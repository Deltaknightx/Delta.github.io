        <h2>What Is HTTP?</h2>
        <p>
          The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is the foundation of web communication.
          It enables browsers and servers to exchange information using a simple, reliable
          request–response model that has powered the web since its earliest days.
        </p>

        <div class="info-box fade-in">
          Today, HTTP works seamlessly with HTTPS — the secure version of the protocol —
          to protect data using modern encryption standards.
        </div>

        <p>
          You can explore the origins and early versions of HTTP on the
          <a href="history.html">History</a> page.

        <h2>Why HTTP Continues to Evolve</h2>
        <p>
          As the internet expanded, websites became richer, more dynamic, and more complex.
          The original versions of HTTP were not designed for video streaming, real-time applications,
          or large-scale interactive services. To address these challenges, new versions such as
          <strong>HTTP/1.1</strong>, <strong>HTTP/2</strong>, and <strong>HTTP/3</strong> introduced
          improvements in speed, security, and efficiency.
        </p>

        <div class="info-box fade-in">
          HTTP/3 is the newest version and uses QUIC, a protocol built on top of UDP that provides
          faster, more reliable connections even on unstable networks.
        </div>

        <p>
          To learn more about these improvements, visit the
          <a href="modern.html">Modern HTTP</a> page.

        <h2>Core Concepts Behind Web Communication</h2>
        <p>
          Understanding HTTP involves studying related ideas such as methods, status codes,
          persistent connections, encryption, and multiplexing.
        </p>

        <p>
          A full list of these important concepts can be found on the
          <a href="concepts.html">Key Concepts</a> page.
